<H2>Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis</H2>

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qrWxCh2/Cyclistic-Bike-Share.png" alt="Cyclistic-Bike-Share" border="0"></a>

This analysis is an optional Capstone project from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics">Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate</a> on Coursera.

<b>About The Company</b><br>

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. The program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 
692 stations across Chicago. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships.

Lily Moreno, Cyclistic's Marketing Manager, believes that maximizing the number of annual members from the pool of casual users will be key to future growth.

<b>Business Task</b>



Analyze 12 months of Cyclistic trip data to gain insights into how members and casual riders are using the Cyclistic bikes differently. Use these insights to determine why a casual rider would buy an annual membership and how to market annual memberships to casual riders.
